							<li><h2>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h2></li>
								<strong><big>Summary</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>Michael and Charlie are old friends who meet at Mack's Diner. Michael was worried about Charlie's slow walking, but Charlie says it's just due to age. Charlie has been working at Twelve Pillars since the beginning, before that he was in business. Michael says Amy is doing well and he has been putting more time into their relationship by taking her out once a week. Michael is content with his life but wishes he was further along in his career and feels like he's not living up to his potential. Charlie advises Michael to keep working at maintaining his relationship like a garden and asks about his career goals.</big></p>
								<br/>
								<strong><big>Reflection</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>This chapter has taught me to practice gratitude and appreciate for what I have. Similarly to Michael, I should also try to cultivate more positive relationships and treat others with kindness and respect. As I also interpreted from this chapter, I am currently pursuing my passions and finding joy in my pursuits; but I should also learn from the times when I may fall down and lose my strength and motivation, as I practice self-reflection and improvement as well. I should also focus on the present moment and don't dwell on the past or worry about the future.</big></p>
							<li><h2>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h2></li>
								<strong><big>Summary</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>The chapter describes a conversation between Charlie and Michael about the importance of designing one's life plan and avoiding falling into someone else's plan. Charlie quotes Mr. Davis, "We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret" and explains that time is expensive and should be spent wisely on important opportunities aligned with one's goals. Michael admits that his days are spent getting by on work, but Charlie warns him against the time management trap of spending time on the urgent rather than the important. Michael's pager goes off and he has to leave, but he thanks Charlie for the advice and promises to visit again soon.</big></p>
								<br/>
								<strong><big>Reflection</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>As Charlie quoted from Mr. Davis, I must choose between the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Life goes by quickly, and I should live with purpose and achieve my goals. Every day I should take advantage of whatever limited opportunities present themselves, and spend my time wisely on what aligns with my goals and aid in my overall personal development. I also learned from the chapter that it is important to design my own life's plan, or risk falling into someone else's. Time management is also emphasized in this chapter as I learned that I should be the master of my own time. Lastly, I learned that it is good to help younger generations and pass on valuable lessons that I learned growing up as well.</big></p>
							<li><h2>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2></li>
								<strong><big>Summary</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big><q>Surround yourself with the best</q> is one of the principles from Mr. Davis's Pillars of Success that Charlie is teaching to Michael. It means to surround oneself with successful, motivated people who have values and skills that you want to acquire. Charlie explains that the people in your life have a powerful influence on your destiny and that it's important to be mindful of the effect they are having on you. Charlie asks Michael to think about his three closest friends and what they do for a living, what they do for fun, and how they influence him.</big></p>
								<br/>
								<strong><big>Reflection</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>From this chapter I learned that I should practice self-awareness. I should also seek out new experiences and step out of my comfort zone, which I wholeheartedly agree with. Surrounding myself with supportive people is also key in how I evolve as a person considering the effect those closest to me have on my own mindset. I also learned that self-reflection is also key to improvement. However, I should focus on growth and learning, instead of perfection. Rather than avoiding challenges, I should embrace them as opportunities for for my further development as well. Nurturing self-compassion and treating myself with kindness and understanding is also a key lesson I should follow as well.</big></p>
							<li><h2>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h2></li>
								<strong><big>Summary</big></strong>
								<br/>
								<p><big>Charlie is emphasizing the importance of self-education and the three mainstays of learning: reading books, observing successful people, and reflecting on personal experiences. He stresses the importance of continuous learning in order to succeed and improve one's life. Michael reveals he has not read a book in years, to which Charlie is shocked and says this is part of Michael's problem. He invites Michael to sit down to discuss the matter more seriously.</big></p>
								<br/>
								<strong><big>Reflection</big></strong>
								<br/>					
								<p><big>This chapter conveyed that a successful person is always a life-long learner, and that self-education is key to success. I should foster continuous learning and growth as well, with the difference between formal education (which only provides a living) and self-education (which can lead to fortune) in mind as well. This chapter also mentions three ways to engage in self-education: reading books, learning from successful people through observation, and reflecting on one's own experiences.</big></p>
