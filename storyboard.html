						<li><h2>Theme</h2></li>
							<p><big>The colour of the background image for this website is predominantly blue in order to invoke a sense of calmness in its target audience and was personally used by myself because it invoked a sense of freedom for me as it reminded me of the sky. The majority of the images used were also animated rather than including real people or objects to let the target audience instantly focus more on the only real image of myself in my professional webpage.</big></p>
						<li><h2>Target Audience</h2></li>
							<p><big>This website is intended for individuals who would like to learn more about me personally and professionally, including my instructors, acquaintances, friends and relatives as well. Other intended viewers may be potential employers interested in determining my level of proficiency in HTML web design.</big></p>
						<li><h2>Website Features</h2></li>
							<p><big>The following features will be used throughout the website to enhance its visual appeal, organization and overall creativity:</big></p>
							<ul type="circle"><big>
								<li><b>Tables</b> play a major part in the design of the website by ensuring that its content is organized very neatly. For instance, they are used as containers in order to ensure that most text in particular do not extend all the way to the end of the visitor's device. Most of the website's content will be contained in tables without borders considering that making the borders visible would not be quite visually appealing.</li>
								<br/>
								<li><b>Images</b> are used to enhance the vibrance of the website in terms of its background for instance, and for supporting various points and explanations made by giving graphical representations.</li>
								<br/>
								<li><b>Lists</b> are used to organize various points and sections made throughout the website.</li>
								<br/>
								<li><b>Hyperlinks</b> (both external and internal) are used in the navigation bar for each webpage and for some images as well.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>An <b>iFrame</b> is used below to show the wireframes for each webpage.</li>
							</big></ul>

							</center>
							<p><big>As seen in  the iframe above, this website consists of six(6) webpages:</big></p>						
							<ul type="circle"><big>
								<li>The <b>splash page      </b> introduces the visitor to the website by giving a brief description of its main webpages.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>The <b>personal page    </b> gives a brief summary to my personal life, including my traits, hobbies and so on in order to let the visitor have a basic idea of who I am as a common individual.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>The <b>professional page</b> is somewhat a mirror of my resum√© intended for showcasing my career goals and current position.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>The <b>personal development page</b> briefly highlights my strengths and room for growth as proven by concise summaries and reflections for a few of the chapters I read in the book <q>Twelve Pillars</q> by J. Rohn & C. Widener.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>The <b>storyboard page</b> (this page) is intended to give the visitor an insight in the creative process of the website's design.</li>
								<br/>
								<li>The <b>reference page</b> consists of the external websites visited that contributed to the overall development of this website</li>
							</big></ul>
